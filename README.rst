**This is my solution to the coding challenge**

I have designed this to be deployable easily as a production caliber solution.

The dependencies are in requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

To run unit tests:
python -m unittest discover

To run the job with sample input (you can use any file you would like)
python jobs/triplets_job.py sample_input.txt

We can discuss how this would be run on EMR or Hadoop / scheduling
